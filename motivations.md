Career Change Motivation

There are a few connected reasons behind my career change. For the past 5 years I've been working in HR. I got into my HR career path from a previous career change out of teaching. After I left teaching I was desperate for a job, and thought I would give HR a try since I had the skill set, and didn't want to waste money going back to get another degree without knowing any other skill set or what I would study.

Since switching to HR, I've unintentionally worked for tech based companies, and have been surrounded by developers. I've always been a life long learned and had been fascinated by the developers work.

After finding a mentor in HR that really wanted to develop my career, I realized I was really unhappy with HR work, and through my HR work with Engineering departments, realized I'm ready to take a leap of faith in learning how to code.
